            <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
                I am a highly detail-oriented and strategic professional, passionate about solving complex problems and building products that enhance user experiences. With a background in digital marketing, virtual assistance, and a growing expertise in product management, I am always driven by a mission to create impactful solutions.

            <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
                My journey started in the realm of digital marketing, where I developed skills in campaign management, lead generation, and customer relationship building. After transitioning into a product management role, I focused on product development cycles, market research, and feature prioritization to align with user needs. I thrive in collaborative environments where my creativity and analytical skills can be put to the test.

            <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
                As a product manager, I specialize in utilizing tools like Jira, Linear, and Figma to drive projects forward, ensuring that each phase—from ideation to deployment—is executed with precision. I also have a solid foundation in QA testing, where I perform API and backend testing to ensure the highest standards of quality in the products I manage.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
                Outside of work, I’m a fast learner with a passion for adapting to new challenges. I love diving into new technologies and methodologies to stay ahead of the curve. When I’m not focusing on work, you can find me exploring new ideas, reading, or engaging in creative projects that allow me to express my diverse interests.
